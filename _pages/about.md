I am a Computer Science graduate with interests in algorithms and complexity, logic, formal languages, and theoretical computer science more generally. I completed a B.Sc. at the <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/">University of Birmingham</a>.

For my final-year project, I worked with <a href="https://rajeshchitnis.github.io/">Dr. Rajesh Chitnis</a> on <a href="/assets/pdf/project.pdf"><strong>ETH-based hardness for approximation via L-reductions from Matrix Tiling with &le;</strong></a>. The thesis was ranked <strong>Top&nbsp;5% of my cohort</strong>.

### Documents
- <a href="/assets/pdf/cv.pdf">CV (PDF)</a>  
- <a href="/assets/pdf/transcript.pdf">Transcript (PDF)</a>  

### Projects & drafts
- **PTAS lower bounds for geometric covering.** Established a PTAS lower bound via L-reductions from Matrix Tiling with &le;; applied to **Covering Points with Squares**, yielding a tight lower bound.  
  <a href="/assets/pdf/covering-squares-draft.pdf">Working draft (PDF)</a>


I am currently looking for PhD opportunity.
