I am undergraduate student in <a href='https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/computer-science'>Computer Science</a> at <a href='https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/'> the University of Birmingham</a>, I am interested in Theoretical Computer Science.
For my final year project, I worked with <a href='https://rajeshchitnis.github.io/'>Dr. Rajesh Chitnis</a>. The title for my research project is "ETH-based Hardness for Approximation via L-Reductions from Matrix Tiling with â‰¤" which can be viewed <a href="/assets/pdf/project.pdf">here</a>.
I am currently looking for PhD opportunity.
