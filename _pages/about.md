I am a Computer Science graduate with interests in algorithms and complexity, logic, formal languages, and theoretical computer science more generally. I completed a B.Sc. at the <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/">University of Birmingham</a>.

For my final-year project, I worked with <a href="https://rajeshchitnis.github.io/">Dr. Rajesh Chitnis</a> on <strong>ETH-based hardness for approximation via L-reductions from Matrix Tiling with &le;</strong>. The thesis was ranked <strong>Top&nbsp;5% of my cohort</strong>.
